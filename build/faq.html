        <h3>What is Kinguin.io?</h3>
        <p>Kinguin.io is a decentralized marketplace for digital games, items and services, enabling global player-to-player trade empowered by blockchain and smart contracts.

        <h3>What are Krowns?</h3>
        <p>The Krown Token is a cryptocurrency for a new generation of online players looking to monetize their game experience. Krowns allow the global gaming community to profit from the buildout and adoption of a decentralized economy. At first, Krowns will be implemented for games and in-game items. As we grow, it will also become a monetization utility for indie developers and studios (Smart Publishing) and our new freelance economy (Micro-Services).</p>

        <h3>What are GoldKrowns?</h3>
        <p>Gold is a unique state of our Krown tokens. GoldKrowns are exclusively designed to be gifted back to the online gaming community. We’re so committed to giving back to our community, that 10% of Kinguin.io’s revenue is actually donated back to content creators. In 2018, millions of existing Kinguin customers will receive GoldKrowns with[a] a potential value worth millions of dollars. Our community will select their favorite streamers, pro gamers, meme-creators or indie developers. It’s millions for the community, by the community.</p>

      <li>
        <h3>How do Smart Contracts work?</h3>
        <p>A smart contract records and facilitates transactions of goods, items, or services. For our purposes, smart contracts receive, store, and send Krowns (plus user hash, tx hash, and timestamp) according to unalterable algorithmic instructions. It does this only once the terms agreed upon by both transacting parties have been fulfilled. In other words, the transition state of each account updates immediately, and registers permanently on the blockchain. Thus, smart contracts provide an extra layer of protection for gamers accruing value on the Kinguin.io platform.</p>

        <h3>I’m a Developer, What is the Kinguin Smart Publishing Program?</h3>
        <p>In the near future, Indie Developers will be able to publish their games to the Kinguin community using smart contracts powered by the Ethereum blockchain. This will allow content creators to monetize their audiences in full compliance with EU Directives.

      <li>
        <h3>How Do I Use Krowns?</h3>
        <p>The overall Kinguin shopping experience will remain exactly the same. Shoppers in the Kinguin.io marketplace will hold Krowns in an Ethereum-based wallet. For most transactions on the web marketplace, during the checkout process the shopper will be presented with a price in Krowns (KRS) and a wallet address, to which they will then send the allotted price of Krowns.</p>

  [a]this claim is true, even though it hasn't started yet?
  [b]Obviously I know USD is just currency, but maybe we just dodge this one for now? It raises questions about the US "unveiling." -->
